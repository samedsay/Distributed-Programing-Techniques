                      --Non-blocking I/O – shared mapped file--

  Write simple two applications (it may be one application which operates in two modes)
which communicate with each other by saving and reading data from a shared file
mapped with into memory.
  
  One of the application should save some data – e.g. two integer values. The other
application should retrieve the data and perform some operation – e.g. adding the values
read – and then print out the result to the console.
NOTE: Your solution should be based on non-blocking I/O implementation.
